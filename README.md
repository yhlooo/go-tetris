# go-tetris

**ðŸš§ THIS IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš§**

Project objectives:

- Implement a Tetris library in Go (mostly implemented)
- Terminal-based Tetris implementation (mostly completed, see [Releases](https://github.com/yhlooo/scaf/releases) or use Docker image [`ghcr.io/yhlooo/tetris:latest`](https://github.com/yhlooo/tetris/pkgs/container/tetris))
- WASM-based browser-playable Tetris (still in its very early stages, visit [go-tetris](https://yhlooo.github.io/go-tetris/))
